        <h2>Description of Curry</h2>

        <p>Japanese curry rice, also known as "kare raisu" in Japanese, is a popular dish that has become a staple of Japanese cuisine. It consists of a thick and flavorful curry sauce served over steamed white rice, often accompanied by meat (usually chicken or beef) and vegetables such as potatoes, carrots, and onions.
            The curry sauce used in Japanese curry rice typically contains a blend of spices including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and nutmeg. The addition of honey or apple can add sweetness to the dish while milk or coconut milk may be added to give it a creamy texture. The combination of these ingredients results in a rich savory flavor with just the right amount of spiciness that makes it an irresistible comfort food for many people around the world.
